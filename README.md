# Human-Resource-Data-Science-Project
Data analysis of employees attrition and the factors behind it


The main objective of this project is to analyze the data provided by the human resource department of a company whose 3571 employees have left.
The objective is to answer two business questions:

                1. What type of employees are leaving?
                2. Which employees are prone to leave next?

The workflow entails:

a. Data Inspection: Number of datapoints, columns, missing data etc.
b. Data Exploration: The Pearson's correlation coefficient is used to 
study the relationship between the data attributes presented to understand why the employees are exiting the company.
The correlation results are discussed in relation to the business questions and hypothesis formulated to help answer the question.
Detailed comparison is drawn with another dataset of the current employees to further guide the answer to the business question.
